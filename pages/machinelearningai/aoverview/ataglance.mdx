# Overview: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## What is Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Machine Learning is a new, and rapidly growing branch of Artifical Intelligence.  Currently you may have heard of it in the form of Stable Diffusion AKA those AI generated art images going around the internet — but its been around for longer than all of us have realized. 

Take, for example — your Facebook timeline, Netflix recommendations, IMDB references, or even the Not Hot Dog algorithm from HBO's Silicon Valley — those are all examples of ML in practice. 

## Why should I care?

With ML rapidly becoming more and more involved in our daily life, it's important that we make sure we understand how this tool works.  If we're choosing to work with ML as well, it's important to understand that we're doing so ethically and equitably.
