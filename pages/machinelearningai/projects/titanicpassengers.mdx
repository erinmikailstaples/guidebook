# Calculating Survivors on the Titanic
*an introductory to machine learning,Â adapted from a tutorial on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com).*

## Overview
*Spoiler Alert* the Titanic sunk. Now, if you've been hiding under a rock, completely blocked any mention of ship, ship wrecks, early Leonardo DeCaprio films, or even the concept if "was there *really* room for two on that door???" I apologize.  But if you are familiar with what happened, lets have some fun with the datasets behind the wreckage any ways. 

No need for this to be a tragedy with a completely *sunk* cost. (Ok, I know, I know). 

## The Question at hand. 
(and no, it's not "who made the mistake of skipping dessert?")

**Based on the following Titanic datasets provided, (name, age, price of ticket, etc) try and predict who will survive and who will die.**

- [Provided Datasets from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakibinesar/titanic-tutorial)

## Let's train a learning model to figure out who all survived (and who should have had seconds of the dessert cart!)

Kaggle reaffirms me that I will *not* need any prior machine learning experience, nor even coding experience for this tutorial, but I'm hoping prior knowledge in python, programming and even playing around with a few previous datasets will lend a hand.

  **Pet Peeve!** It's a personal pet peeve of mine when educational sites say things like "it's simple", or "it's easy," â€” this makes a base assumption of what the reader existingly knows. **Everyone** has different background knowledge and experiences and not taking this into consideration can really harm the entire learning process and make someone feel lost.

  EXPERTS GOOGLE THINGS! DAILY! WE ALL ARE FIGURING IT OUT ONE BIT AT A TIME.
