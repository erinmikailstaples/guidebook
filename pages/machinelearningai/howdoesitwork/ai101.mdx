# AI 101 

"With the right data and the right model, AI can solve many problems. But choosing the problem, finding the data and training the model can be difficult." â€” [AI 101](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-013-ai-101-fall-2021/resources/mitres6-013f21_ai_101-human_1/) with Brandon Leshchinskiy

## Two types of AI 
AI can be general, or AI can be narrow.

### General AI 
General AI is a very general definition of AI, meaning that it can do a variety of tasks. This is the type of AI that comes to mind when we think of Terminator or doomsday predictions. 

Experts debate if this is possible, and if so, when it will be.

### Narrow AI 
Narrow AI is AI that is doing a specific set of tasks that are trained. For example, self-driving cars. 

A self driving car can navigate a course, but it could likely not learn a new language or cook you a meal. 

## Typical AI Tasks 

### Vision Processing 
### Language Processing 
### Planning Tasks
