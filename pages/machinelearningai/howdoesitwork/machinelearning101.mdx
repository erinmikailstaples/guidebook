# Machine Learning

## Overview

Machine learning is a way to predict decisions based on different sets of data. Using data, you can decide how to structure queries and then predict information based off of those queries.

ML relies on **understanding and identifying patterns** in data. Capturing patterns in data is called **fitting** or **training** a model. 

The initial data used to create the model, is called the **training data**.

  **Brain Blast!** Because ML models rely so much on data, making sure you're using or providing accurate, ethical, inclusive, and insightful data, and categorizing it inclusively is *essential* to build a better future in machine learning.

## When do we use machine learning? 

### Classification 
Here's some input data, give me an output or a class. 
Image > what kind of animal is it?

### Clustering 
Here is some input data, sort this by what is similar data.

### Regression Data
Here is some input data, what is the mathematical output or prediction that would come next?

## Types of Learning
There are three types of learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

### Supervised learning 
You know the answers (labels) and are training the model to understasnd them. 

### Unsupervised Learning
I have no external reference or information on what this belongs to â€” largely used in clustering 

### Reinforcement Learning 
You don't have the right answer â€” but have some sort of guide on how to get there or end result goal. This is commonly used in robotics.

Reinforcement learning requires a really really good simulation. If your simulations are not realistic, then you're struggling with how it could come to mind.

## Decision Trees, the basics

Models are built commonly off of **Decision Trees**.  Decision Trees are a way of sorting data that makes logical sense based upon a pattern.

Decision trees can be built with as few as two decisions.

â”œâ”€â”€ Cookie
â””â”€â”€ Filling

### Not all decisions have one factor

As with life, (and Oreos for that matter) not all things are black and white (or cookie and filling). While the parts of an Oreo Cookie may in fact be a binary, in which there are only two outcomes, not all things are.

Let's look at this decision tree below and explore how it might relate to say... airline seat prices.

First off, with an airline seating chart you have a few different factors at play. Did you splurge and get that First Class experience, or are you riding economy?

Is it a window seat? Aisle seat? or did you get stuck in the middle? 

What about emergency exit rows? Front or back of the plane? Next to the bathrooms? These all are things that can impact the price of the decision tree.

Airline Seat Prices
â”œâ”€â”€ First Class
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Aisle Seat
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Window Seat
â”œâ”€â”€ Business Class
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Aisle Seat 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Window Seat 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Middle Seat
â””â”€â”€ Middle Class
    â”œâ”€â”€ Aisle Seat 
    â”œâ”€â”€ Window Seat 
    â””â”€â”€ Middle Seat



Using the tree built, you can predict the price of your seat based on the different characteristcs provided.  The end price will be what it comes to at the bottom of the tree, or the **leaf**.

## Decision Trees aren't the only model used in ML

Decision trees are not the only model used in machine learning, there are other models commonly used. 

These include:
