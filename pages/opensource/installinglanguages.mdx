# Why do you need to install programming languages?
When I first started coding, admittedly I didn't think too much of it. Granted, 99% of the time, I was working directly in [GitHub], or straight from the [Terminal] hoping I didn't break anything in the process.

First off — it's important to know what a [[programming language]] is in the first place. Any [programming language] is actually a language that enables the average person to talk with a human and a computer.

This great blog post on [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/) defines it as such: 
>> “Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!” [from Code Foundations](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/code-foundations?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=content_mktg&utm_content=programming_language)

> And programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. Computers “think” in binary — strings of 1s and 0s. Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write. A programming language is made up of a series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.

In order to actually get the computer to understand what you've put into a text document, you have to install the [[complier]] or [[library]] that the computer can take your text and convert it to that binary code that the computer can understand.

This example from [u/commieside on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/grreon/what_does_it_mean_to_install_a_programming/) actually is what makes it click for me:
>"Open a text document and put in your code. Now what? The computer can’t do anything with it that way.
>
>So you need to install a compiler and libraries, so the computer can take your higher level program and convert it into machine code that your computer can actually understand.

>It’s sort of like a real world translator. If you wanted to write a letter to someone in Russia that only knew Russian, you’d have to write your letter, hand it to the translator to put it in Russian, then they send it to your friend."
