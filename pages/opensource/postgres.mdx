[Postgres is a type of language](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql) used to help people store, retrieve, and derive insights from data.  This is the essence of all software applications.

[[SQL]] or [[Structured Query Language]] is the most frequent way of retrieving and working with that data.

*notes and process from the PostgreSQL tutorial*

### 1. What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL (_often shortened to simply "**Postgres**"_) is an advancedÂ **R**elationalÂ **D**ataBaseÂ **M**anagementÂ **S**ystem ("RDBMS"), that lets youÂ _efficiently_Â andÂ _securely_storeÂ _any_Â type of data. We willÂ _explain_Â "[[Relational Database]]" in the context of ourÂ _example_Â below, so don't worry if it sounds like a buzzword soup.

#### PostgreSQL v. SQL
SQL is simply the preferred means of interacting with data while PostgresSQL is the added standards compliance and extensibility used to enhance the data.

Before you can begin using posgreSQL â€” you must first install it.

You can navigate to https://postgresapp.com and click `download` to do so.

> [!QUESTION] [[Why do I need to download or install programming languages?]]
> This is something I struggled with when I first started coding â€” I didn't understand *why* I needed to download or install items in order to code. The TL;DR â€” you're providing a *translator* to the computer to understand what language you're writing in.

Once the app is downloaded from posgresapp.com, you'll further install it in the terminal by using the following lines within your terminal.

	mkdir -p /etc/paths.d && echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp

You'll know the installation worked when you can type `psql` in your terminal and receive the following response. *note â€” replace your username, where my username is located* ðŸ˜‰
