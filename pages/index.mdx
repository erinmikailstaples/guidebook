# Open Guide

**Open Guide** is a project built and maintained by [Erin Mikail Staples](https://erinmikailstaples.com) to publish the notes she takes along her learning journey in a way that they can be access by everyone.

This site is [open to contributions](https://github.com/erinmikailstaples/guidebook) from others who believe in maintaining the philosophy of **learning in public** and **sharing what you know**

### Why Open Guide?
The concept of an open guide has been in my brain for a while. I've always loved Open Source, collaborative education, and the concept of learning in public and sharing what you know. However, due to my own impostor syndrome, time limitations and life â€” this has been a project put on the backburner for a while. 

During the last few months, I've really doubled down on my exploration and self-learning. Personally, I've discovered that creating guides allows me to best comprehend new topics or ideas as I go. Now, I'm workign to better share them with others, by open sourcing these guides and inviting new folks to contribute their own guides rather than using Obsidian.  I likely will continue to use Obsidian for my first-drafts and ideas (feel free to follow along [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/erinmikail)), but would love to keep this as a more polished guidebook of resources.

# Current Learning Exlorations
Currently I've been focusing on leveling up my technical skills, as well as teaching others the basics to technical education. I'm currently discovering more about **Python**, **Open Source**, **Next.js**, **Machine Learning**, **Open Journalism** and **Platform Ethics**.

Previously, I have researched topics and have demonstrated expertise in **community building**, **journalism business models**, **content moderation**, **fandom**, **online safety**, **misinformation and disinformation**, **user experience** and **educational content**.

## The power of multi-variates
As a **multi-variate professional** I believe in the power of **exploration** and **curiousity** and strongly believe that this encourages, and facilites a stronger future. It's wonderful and strongly encouraged to be an expert in something.  We all have things that we're experts at. However, if we don't work to better understand other skills outside of our area of expertise, we will never be able to develop empathy and understanding where we need it most. 

True collaboration requires us to be open, empathetic and understanding to new ways of doing things. Curiousity and exploration facilitate this skillset.

# Tech Stack
The tools used getting this site up include: [Vercel](www.vercel.com), [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), [Warp](https://warp.dev), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

# Current Focus
Here is the current focus of this project. 
- [ ] Transferring existiing guides from Obsidian. (Publicly available [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/erinmikail/Home))
- [ ] Create code of conduct
- [ ] Create readme page
- [ ] Upload: Introduction to Machine Learning + available
- [ ] Define: What is a guide, vs. Tutorial, vs. Walkthrough, vs. Theory? 
- [ ] Identify: How will references be checked? What precident will this establish?
