# What does it mean to be technically skilled? 
When we hear that someone is technical — our minds quickly jump to the notion of being a developer, an engineer, a hardware expert or someone who excels in stereotypically assumed STEM fields. Our brains quickly jump to a vision of someone who spends hours behind a screen, is antisocial, and logical to a fault. This stereotyped notion, much like many other stereotyped notions, does not only the individuals who hold these roles no favors, but also damages the industry as a whole.

**The misconception of technical knowledge gate keeps industries from those who have been systemically shoved out of STEM fields.  Through clarifying what technical skillsets are and advocating for these these skills in public spaces — we can increase equality in historically exclusionary industries.**

### What does it mean to be technical?
Stereotyped visions aside — ***what does it really mean to be technical?*** We've attempted having this conversation before, told through blog posts on '[what does technical mean?](https://opensource.com/article/21/2/what-technical#:~:text=According%20to%20Dictionary.com%2C%20%22,used%20in%20sports%20or%20arts)),' '[Succeeding in tech as a non-technical person](https://www.benjamindada.com/succeeding-tech-non-technical-person-20-experts/),' or even '[How can a non-tech person be successful in a tech industry](https://nupaths.org/non-tech-person-successful-in-tech-industry/)?'. 

The problem lies in still being tied to the misconception of what it means to work a technical role.  We hold tight onto the various assumptions that we're making.

Looking at these articles — we can find a few stereotypical similarities: a need to be good at mathematics, be proficient in code, or could *hack into a mainframe* (whatever the hell that means).  They'll also quickly reiterate that *you too* could be in a technical industry — which is not wrong, but it fails to negate this misconception of what it means to be technical.

Simply put, being **technical** simply means:
	1. having special and usually practical knowledge especially of a mechanical or scientific subject. marked by or characteristic of specialization
	2. of or relating to a particular subject
	3. based on or marked by a strict or legal interpretation
	4. of or relating to [technique](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technique)
	*[Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technical)*

While yes, even in the dictionary we draw a parallel to a mechanical or scientific subject — not wrong. We're also conflating the word 'technical' with the word 'logical'. 

Being **logical** means to 
	1. of, relating to, involving, or being in accordance with [logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic), skilled in logic. formally true or valid.
	2. capable of reasoning or of using reason in an orderly cogent fashion
